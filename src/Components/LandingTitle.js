            Starting out from game development, I am currently pursuing software engineering / development with a focus in front-end aspects. My interests are in Front-End Graphics Rendering / Technical Art and Full-stack development.

During my free-time from schoolwork, I enjoy exploring the different aspects of frontend web/app development.
